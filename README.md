# CK3ModTools
This is a tool designed for the fast modification of Crusader Kings III. It was designed with total conversion mods in mind, but can also be used with the base game. The goal with this project is to provide tools to modders to make mod creation as fast and as easy as possible. The origin of this project started when the creator (nathannewcomer) wanted to make a total conversion mod for Crusader Kings II, but found few mod tools to aid him with tasks like creating thousands of provinces easily.

## What does it do?
- Load province information from files
- Modify provinces in a GUI environment
- Generate new files from your modifications

## What can't it do?
- Create new provinces
  - To create new provinces, you must modify provinces.png using an image editor (e.g. GIMP, PhotoShop)
  
## How do I use it?
To be implemented

## How do I contribute?
This was made using Eclipse, so the instructions will set up the Eclipse environment. It may be possible to use other IDEs, but has not been tested.
- Download Eclipse for Java
- Download a JDK, JDK 14 was used but the newest version should work as well.
- Install the e(fx)clipse extension for Eclipse
- (Recommended) Install SceneBuilder \- this allows you to edit the layout in a GUI environment and get immediate feedback.

- Edit the code
- Submit a pull request
